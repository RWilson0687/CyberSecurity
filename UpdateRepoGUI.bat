:: Breakdown
::
::This batch file performs a series of tasks related to Git version control. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:
::
::    Setup Environment:
::        @echo off prevents commands from being displayed in the console.
::        setlocal starts a local scope for environment variables.
::
::    Display Initial Message:
::        It outputs the word "Actions" to indicate the operations that will follow.
::
::    Open Folder Selection Dialog:
::        It uses PowerShell to launch a folder selection dialog. The user can choose a directory, and the selected path is stored in the variable repoDir.
::
::    Check for User Cancellation:
::        If the user cancels the dialog (i.e., no directory is selected), it displays a message saying "No directory selected. Exiting." and exits the script.
::
::    Change Directory:
::        It attempts to change to the specified directory (repoDir). If the directory is invalid, it shows an error message and exits.
::
::    Prompt for Commit Message:
::        The script prompts the user to enter a commit message, which will be stored in the variable commitMessage.
::
::    Stage Changes:
::        It stages all changes in the Git repository using git add ..
::
::    Commit Changes:
::        The script commits the staged changes with the user-provided commit message.
::
::    Push to Remote Repository:
::        It pushes the committed changes to the main branch of the remote repository.
::
::    Pause:
::
::    Finally, it pauses the script to allow the user to read any output before closing the console.
